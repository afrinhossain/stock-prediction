# Stock Price Prediction Project

This Python project demonstrates the use of time series data to predict stock prices. In this example, historical stock price data is used to predict future prices using a Random Forest Regressor.

## Overview

- **Features:** Various features such as year, month, day, day of the week, weekend indicator, and the previous day's closing price are engineered to train the model.

- **Model:** The machine learning model used is a Random Forest Regressor. The model is trained on historical stock data and used to predict future stock prices.
